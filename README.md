### Ingredients

- 1 (12-ounce) can SPAM® Classic, cut into cubes
- 2 fresh chives, chopped, if desired
- 4 large eggs
- 1/4 cup milk

### Directions

In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk.

In a greased skillet, cook the egg mixture over medium-high heat, pulling with a spatula to allow the liquid to contact the skillet surface, until desired doneness.

Add the SPAM® Classic to the skillet and reduce the heat, gently stirring the mixture until the SPAM® Classic is heated thoroughly. Garnish with chives.
